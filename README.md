# Hydro-Bot---Automatic-water-level-controller
This project presents an automatic water level controller circuit with a manual switching option. The circuit utilizes a 555 timer IC to automatically turn on and off the motor based on the water level in the tank using three wires for water level detection. To use it, you will have to just plugin the circuit and that's it.
